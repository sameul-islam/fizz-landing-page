![FizzUp Banner](./src/assets/banner.png)

## Project Overview

**Fizz Landing Page** is a modern, responsive landing page designed for a beverage brand called **Whizz**. This landing page includes multiple sections: product showcase, company story, FAQs, blog posts, contact form, and a professional footer. The goal is to provide an attractive, user-friendly, and interactive interface inspired by professional beverage websites like Coca-Cola.

During development, I explored modern UI/UX ideas, implemented smooth animations, and created a fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
